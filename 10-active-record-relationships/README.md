# ActiveRecord Relationships

- Where does ActiveRecord come from again?
- What' this ORM thing?
- Migrations?
- Model vs Class vs Table
- CRUD

## Our domain today - Pizza

- Eater has many pizzas, so ... `has_many :pizzas`

```rb
class Eater < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :pizzas
end
```

- PizzaTopping is on a pizza and has toppings, thus it `belongs_to :pizza` and `belongs_to :topping`

```rb
class PizzaTopping < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :pizza
  belongs_to :topping
end
```

- Pizza was bought by someone, so ... `belongs_to :eater`, `has_many :pizza_toppings`, and `has_many :toppings, through: :pizza_toppings`

```rb
class Pizza < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :eater
  has_many :pizza_toppings
  has_many :toppings, through: :pizza_toppings
end
```

- Topping is composed of many things and can be reused as a recipte, therefore `has_many :pizza_toppings` and `has_many :pizzas, through :pizza_toppings`

```rb
class Topping < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :pizza_toppings
  has_many :pizzas, through: :pizza_toppings
end
```

```ruby
# How doe we write our models again?
class ModelNameInCapitalizedCamelCase << ActiveRecord::Base
  # Describe relationships here
end
```

- What is a model again?
- 4 steps you need to take for every model to work:
- - create it
- - generate the migration file and write the contents
- - run the migration, debug anything that needs debugging
- - evaluate the correctness of the schema
- Which models have foreign keys here? How do we know it? What does it even mean? Let's discuss!

SO...

1. Create all models
2. Successfuly get them working with our db (what kind of db is it again? Hint: filedb, not suitable for prod)
3. Create some instances in the console
4. Try to refer to relevant data using instance methods.
5. Bask in AR's glory
6. Look at what you've had to write last week
6. Bask again
7. PROFIT   

## Migration reference

```rb
class CreatePizzatoppingToppingPizzaAndEaterTables < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :pizzas do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :eater_id
    end

    create_table :toppings do |t|
      t.string :name
    end

    create_table :pizza_toppings do |t|
      t.integer :pizza_id
      t.integer :topping_id
    end

    create_table :eaters do |t|
      t.string :name
    end
  end
end
```

## References, tricks and notes

- check out `_` in pry
- [AR docs](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord)
- assigning an array to `topping_ids` on pizza like that: `pizza.topping_ids = [1, 3, 5]`

## AR Methods I've used:

Here's a list of some methods from AR I've used during the lecture. It's not meant to be a comprehensive one, merely a reminder. To get all info about the functionality of AR, remember you should always go to [RAILS GUIDES](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html).

- `Pizza.first`(does go to the db)
- `Pizza.find(3)`(does go to the db)
- `Pizza.first.toppings[0].name`(does)
- `hawaiian = Pizza.find_by(name: "Hawaiian")` (does)
- `dan = Eater.first` (does)
- `hawaiian.eater = dan` (doesn't)
- `hawaiian.save` (does)

If you want to completely avoid the headache of stress regarding the db calls, always use `update` (as opposed to updating a local variable and *then* `.save`-ing) to update your data, `find` (as opposed to referring to a variable) to get the newest bits, and `create` (as opposed to `new`) to create.
